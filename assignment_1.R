# Now that we have learned how to munge (manipulate) data
# and plot it, we will work on using these skills in new ways


####-----Reading in Data and Stacking it ----- ####
#Reading in files
files <- list.files('data',full.names=T)


#Read in individual data files
ndmi <- read_csv(files[1]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndmi')


ndsi <- read_csv(files[2]) %>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndsi')

ndvi <- read_csv(files[3])%>% 
  rename(burned=2,unburned=3) %>%
  mutate(data='ndvi')

# Stack as a tidy dataset
full_long <- rbind(ndvi,ndmi,ndsi) %>%
  gather(key='site',value='value',-DateTime,-data) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value))

##### Question 1 #####
#1 What is the correlation between NDVI and NDMI? - here I want you to
#convert the full_long dataset in to a wide dataset using the 
#function "spread" and then make a plot that shows the correlation as a
# function of if the site was burned or not

#my code
full_wide <- spread(data = full_long, key = "data", value = "value") %>%
  filter_if(is.numeric, all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
  mutate(month = month(DateTime),
         year = year(DateTime))
summary(full_wide)

summer_only <- filter(full_wide, month %in% c(6,7,8,9))
  
ggplot(summer_only, aes(x=ndmi, y=ndvi, color=site)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_few() +
  scale_color_few() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.8))
  
## End Code for Question 1 -----------

#### Question 2 ####
#2) What is the correlation between average NDSI (normalized 
# snow index) for January - April and average NDVI for June-August?
#In other words, does the previous year's snow cover influence vegetation
# growth for the following summer? 


## Your code here

ndsi_winter <- filter(full_wide, month %in% c(1,2,3,4,5)) %>%
  group_by(year, site) %>%
  summarise(ndsi_mean = mean(ndsi))

ndvi_summer <- filter(full_wide, month %in% c(6,7,8)) %>%
  group_by(year, site) %>%
  summarise(ndvi = mean(ndvi))

## End code for question 2 -----------------


###### Question 3 ####
#How is the snow effect from question 2 different between pre- and post-burn
# and burned and unburned? 

## Your code here

## End code for question 3

###### Question 4 #####
#What month is the greenest month on average? Does this change in the burned
# plots after the fire? 

##### Question 5 ####
#What month is the snowiest on average?
